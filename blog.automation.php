      <p>Automation is a term for technology applications where human input is minimized. This includes business process automation (BPA), 
         IT automation, personal applications such as home automation and more. Human intervention is reduced by 
         predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions â€” and embodying those predeterminations in machines.
         Automation, includes the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers, 
         and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, and stabilization of ships, aircraft, and other applications 
         and vehicles with reduced human intervention.            
         Automation covers applications ranging from a household thermostat controlling a boiler, to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found space in the banking sector. In control complexity, it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms.
